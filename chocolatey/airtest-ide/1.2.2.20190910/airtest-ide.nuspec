### About 
* **Airtest** - is an Cross-Platform UI Automation Framework for Games and Apps.

# Features
*   **Write Once, Run Anywhere:** Airtest provides cross-platform APIs, including app installation, simulated input, assertion and so forth. Airtest uses image recognition technology to locate UI elements so that you can automate games and apps without injecting any code.
